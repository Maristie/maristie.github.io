title: Simplify personal website building
---

## Simple introduction

After moving from AWS to my GitHub [personal website](https://maristie.github.io), I still think that it's quite troublesome to use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) to generate static webpages locally and push them to GitHub.

Then I found this [article](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/) by chance. It's just what I need.

Now with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) I just have to upload my articles written in Markdown, and then GitHub will render it to HTML. No redundancy.

The simpler, the better.

## Summary

GitHub Pages supports Jekyll, with which we do **NOT** need to generate static webpages locally and push to GitHub any more. Neither do you need to do it on Linux (in fact I've been working on it on Windows).

I'm sorry that the site has been down for several hours since I'm trying different themes to check if they're appropriate for me.
