title: Notice of site transfer
---

Since now I do realize that it's kind of boring, or rather, meaningless to maintain a static website on the host of AWS on my own, as well as it's soon about to expire in February (in fact it's mainly used as a proxy), I decide that this domain name (www.maristie.site) will be no longer bound to the AWS server then.

All of the contents are now hosted on maristie.github.io and I'll directly update my blog there. I've thought about it and conclude that GitHub has provided the most convenient method to host a website for me.

Now www.maristie.site should be redirected to https://maristie.github.io.

Thanks for reading my articles.

Welcome to the new website!
